# horiSEOn_unexpected_css_challenge

## This is a refactor of the Horiseon challenge. I replaced all of the <div> tags with semantic tags, in both the HTML and CSS files.

## I asked ChatGPT some questions about types of html attributes that can replace <div>, and also asked questions to figure out how I messed up my CSS. Although I then fixed the issue by referring to the starter code.
